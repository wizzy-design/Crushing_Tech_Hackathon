# Crushing Tech Hackathon Reflection

I participated in the Crushing Tech Hackathon, skillfully organized by Frantz Kati (@bahdcoder on Twitter). This enriching experience served as a profound challenge, leading me into the realm of web accessibility. Throughout this project, I acquired invaluable knowledge, including:

- Proficiency in utilizing Aria attributes
- Understanding the functionality and significance of screen readers
- Execution of screen reader tests for comprehensive accessibility evaluation
- Mastery of keyboard accessibility testing techniques

These newfound skills not only broadened my technical expertise but also deepened my commitment to creating inclusive and user-friendly digital experiences. The Crushing Tech Hackathon proved to be an educational journey that significantly enhanced my understanding of web accessibility principles and practices.
